	abstract = {This paper studies the financial trajectories of large firms that accessed a €200 billion state-backed loan programme in Italy, part of broader interventions to contain corporate distress during the COVID-19 crisis. Using firm-level data from 2016 to 2023, we find that supported firms were initially more leveraged, less profitable and less liquid. Their financial performance, however, improved significantly after the intervention. The recovery in debt servicing capacity, even among the most fragile firms, is mainly driven by increased profitability rather than by an extension of debt maturity. Our findings highlight the role of public guarantees in fostering financial resilience. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Females are underrepresented in academic finance departments, especially among senior faculty. Using information on 2910 finance scholars from 387 universities worldwide, we show that although females have become more common in finance departments over the past 30 years, yet only one in ten full professors are women. We explore whether this gap is associated with a lower likelihood of female faculty transitioning into higher academic ranks and find no significant difference between the sexes. While we cannot rule out the existence of a glass ceiling impacting women, partly due to their higher exit rates from the profession, we primarily attribute the low representation of female finance professors to historic male-centric recruitment activity. Due to the length of time for early-career academics to reach full professor status, gender imbalance at the most senior levels in finance is likely to continue for several years. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We study the introduction of a new control-enhancing mechanism in Italy, a country still characterized by family-controlled firms but with an increasing importance of institutional investors. Since 2014, Italian firms have been able to adopt loyalty shares, which allow a double voting right if shares are continuously held for at least two years. We find that about 20% of listed firms have introduced loyalty shares, and family-controlled firms are the most likely adopters. Loyalty shares neither anticipate acquisitions, nor equity issues by the adopting firm. Instead, they allow controlling shareholders to reduce their equity stake without losing control. We report no evidence of an adverse wealth effect both at the adoption and in the years following it. As expected, institutional investors vote against the introduction of loyalty shares. Yet, they do not reduce their holdings afterwards, as incremental governance costs are outweighed by the superior performance of adopting firms. Overall, our evidence suggests that bolstering family control is the main effect of the introduction of loyalty shares. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Using various centrality measures from social network analysis, we analyze how the location of a lead initial public offering (IPO) underwriter in its network of investment banks affects various IPO characteristics. We hypothesize that investment banking networks allow lead IPO underwriters to induce institutions to pay attention to the firms they take public and to perform two information-related roles during the IPO process: an information dissemination role, in which the lead underwriter uses its investment banking network to disseminate noisy information about various aspects of the IPO firm to institutional investors; and an information extraction role, in which the lead underwriter uses its investment banking network to extract information useful in pricing the IPO firm equity from institutional investors. Based on these two roles, we develop testable hypotheses relating lead IPO underwriter centrality to the IPO characteristics of firms they take public. We find that more central lead IPO underwriters are associated with larger absolute values of offer price revisions, greater IPO and after-market valuations, larger IPO initial returns, greater institutional investor equity holdings and analyst coverage immediately post-IPO, greater stock liquidity post-IPO, and better long-run stock returns. Using a hand-collected data set of pre-IPO media coverage as a proxy for investor attention, we show that an important channel through which more central lead IPO underwriters achieve favorable IPO characteristics is by attracting greater investor attention to the IPOs underwritten by them. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objective Paroxetine is commonly used to treat depression in the elderly; however, titration issues have been raised. Rapid titration may lead to increased anxiety and early dropout. The aim of this cost-utility analysis was to compare the potential benefit of standard (10 mg the first day) versus slow titration (2.5 mg gradually increased). Methods Clinical analysis was based on a naturalistic trial integrated with a decision-analytic model representing second treatments for those who initially did not respond and for dropout cases. Treatment setting was a public outpatient center for mental disorders in Italy. Service use data were estimated from best practice guidelines, whereas costs (Euros; 2012) were retrieved from Italian official sources. Results Slow titration approach produced 0.031 more quality-adjusted life years (remission rate: 57% vs 44% in standard titration group) at an incremental cost of €5.53 (generic paroxetine) and €54.54 (brand paroxetine syrup). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) values were €159 and €1768, respectively, in favor of slow titration approach. Cost-effectiveness threshold, defined as ICER < 1 GDP per capita according to World Health Organization criteria, is about €25 000 in Italy. Conclusions Our results are consistent with a superiority of slow titration of paroxetine in older depressed patients. However, these findings, in part based on simulated data, need to be replicated in clinical trials. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In major depression, when a first antidepressant does not cause remission of symptoms (60%-75%), there are several options for continuing treatment in the next step. This study is a cost-utility analysis (CUA) of different second-line approaches. In a simulated trial outpatients with MDD were treated with citalopram for 13 weeks (level 1), then based on two alternative algorithms implemented from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR<sup>*</sup>D) study. Algorithm A: citalopram was continued until study endpoint (week 26). Algorithm B: patients who remitted during level 1 continued citalopram. Those who did not remit could opt for switching to another antidepressant (venlafaxine; sertraline) (b1) or adding bupropion to citalopram treatment (augmentation; b2). Algorithm B increased remission rate by 10.6% over Algorithm A (number needed to treat: 9.9; sensitivity range: 9.1-12.5). As a comparison, differences between active antidepressants and placebo are associated with NNT values of 6 to 8. In CUA Algorithm B was dominant with an ICER of $11,813 (sensitivity range=$1783 - $21,784), which is <1GDP per capita cost-effectiveness threshold (USA=$47,193). Among Algorithm B options, switching (b1) dominated Algorithm A with a smaller number of responders than augmentation approach (b2) (NNT 11 vs. 7.7), whereas ICER values were similar (b1: $14,738; b2: $15,458). However we cannot exclude a bias in selecting second treatment. This cost-utility analysis shows (in line with current guidelines) a benefit in modifying antidepressant treatment if response to first-line agent does not occur within 3 months, but not a clear-cut evidence in terms of NNT. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We find that institutional investors play a central role in the bid process and can protect minority shareholders from being frozen out in the bid. Specifically, tender offers are less likely to succeed when a firm has institutional investors in its ownership structure. When public-to-private offers are accepted, bid premiums are significantly greater if a financial institution (particularly when it is foreign, independent or activist) has a stake in the firm. We explore the effect of a number of hitherto unexplored factors on the takeover premium and find that shareholder agreements facilitate public-to-private acquisitions. Other factors, such as a threat to merge the target if the bid fails, or external validation of the offer price, have no impact on either the likelihood of delisting or the premium paid by the bidder. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Since the seminal work of Ingersoll (1977b) the optimal time in which a firm should redeem its outstanding convertible bonds has received large attention by the financial literature. Several studies have put forward a number of possible costs and benefits for a firm if it interrupts the life of its convertible bonds prior to their contractual maturity. However, in this paper we argue that the managerial decision to call back a convertible bond is mainly driven by a fundamental variable almost neglected up until now: the time value extraction from bondholders' conversion option. Accordingly, we propose a measure for the effective convenience of calling-which we define as net time value advantage-and we show, using a survival analysis, that it is more effective than previously proposed measures in explaining the firms' observed call policy. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The serotonin transporter 5-HTTLPR polymorphism moderates response to SSRIs and side-effect burden. The aim of this study is to quantify the cost-utility of incorporating 5-HTTLPR genotyping in drug treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). We previously reported a theoretical model to simulate antidepressant treatment with citalopram or bupropion for 12. weeks. The drugs were alternatively selected according to an 'as usual' algorithm or based on response and tolerability predicted by 5-HTTLPR profile. Here we apply this model to conduct a cost-utility analysis in three European regions with high GDP (Euro A), middle GDP (Euro B) and middle-high GDP (Euro C).. In addition we test a verification scenario in which citalopram. +. bupropion augmentation is administered to individuals with the least favorable 5-HTTLPR genotype. Treatment outcomes are remission and Quality Adjusted-Life Weeks (QALW). Cost data (international $, year 2009) are retrieved from the World Health Organization (WHO) and national official sources. In base-case scenario incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) values are $1147 (Euro A), $ 1185 (Euro B) and $1178 (Euro C). From cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC), the probability of having an ICER value below WHO recommended cost-utility threshold (3 GDP per capita = $1926) is > 90% in high-income countries (Euro A). In middle- income regions, these probabilities are < 30% (Euro B) and < 55% (Euro C) respectively. All estimates are robust against variations in treatment parameters, but if genetic test cost decreases to $100, pharmacogenetic approach becomes cost-effective in middle-income countries (Euro B). This simulation using data from 27 European states suggests that choosing antidepressant treatment from the results of 5-HTTLPR might be a cost-effective solution in high income countries. Its feasibility in middle income countries needs further research. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.},

	abstract = {Objective. To evaluate the benefit of pharmacogenetics in antidepressant treatment. Methods. In a simulated trial 100,000 subjects in a current episode of major depressive disorder (MDD) received citalopram or bupropion based on the clinician's decision (algorithm A) or following indications from 5-HTTLPR genetic testing (algorithm B), which effect size of was estimated from a meta-analysis of pharmacogenetic trials. A and B were compared in a cost-utility analysis (12 weeks). Costs (international $, 2010) were drawn from official sources. Treatment effects were expressed as quality-adjusted life weeks (QALWs). Outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results. Under base-case conditions, genetic test use was associated with increases in antidepressant response (0.062 QALWs) and tolerability (0.016 QALWs) but cost benefit was not acceptable (ICER = $2,890; $1,800-$4,091). However, when the joint effect on antidepressant response and tolerability was analyzed in two recurrent episodes, ICER dropped to $1,392 ($837-$1,982). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) showed a >80% probability that ICER value fell below the commonly accepted 3 times Gross Domestic Product (GDP) threshold (World Health Organization) and therefore suggesting cost-effectiveness. Conclusion. Notwithstanding some caveats (exclusion of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions; simple 5-HTTLPR architecture), this simulation is favourable to incorporate pharmacogenetic test in antidepressant treatment. © 2011 Informa Healthcare. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.},

I find strong excess returns around extreme trading levels, which are only moderately attributable to information disclosure. Moreover, these returns are not caused by liquidity fluctuations since prices do not reverse over the following period. In contrast, there is evidence of price momentum, suggesting that traders can implement successful portfolio strategies based on observation of current volumes. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Schizophrenia is associated with a high familiar, social and economic burden. During the recent years early and specific intervention for first psychotic episodes has been suggested to improve the long term outcome of the disease. Despite the promising results obtained so far, early intervention is still scarcely applied. One major problem arises from the translation of research findings into stakeholder policies. In fact very few analyses of cost reductions obtained with early intervention have been reported. In the present paper we present a simulation of direct cost reduction that can be obtained with early intervention programmes. We based our analysis on available data about schizophrenia care costs in Italy and the expected cost reduction with the use of early intervention. We observed that the increase in costs due to the more intensive early intervention is largely compensated by the reduction of inpatient admissions with a reduction of direct costs of 6.01%. Despite the apparently small economic gain, early intervention offers more clinical and social benefits as it seems to be effective also in decreasing relapse rates, in improving the patients' quality of life and disability associated with psychosis and in increasing employment rates. Those indirect costs however are difficult to estimate and were not included in our model. In conclusion, our study supports the use of early intervention in schizophrenia, which could allow an outcome improvement with lower direct and indirect costs. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

	abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to investigate the main motivations for Italian insiders to trade relevant stakes of their companies, specifically assuming that most transactions are driven by speculative intents. According to an information asymmetry hypothesis, insiders, having a superior information set, may better detect the temporary under or overvaluation of stocks. Moreover, when insider trading law is not well enforced, insiders may take advantage of relevant and undisclosed information. In both cases, such transactions would convey an important signal to uninformed traders. Design/methodology/approach In order to determine whether insiders are able to earn abnormal returns, a standard event study methodology is used and, then, a profitable mimicking portfolio strategy is proposed. Findings The paper finds statistical evidence of a positive relationship between the change of holdings and the sign of market movement: excess returns are earned after a positive increase of relevant stakes and negative abnormal returns follow an opposite insiders' strategy. In particular, we find significant excess returns between the first and the third month following insiders' transactions. Market response is generally higher for insiders' purchases rather than sales and for insiders owning more than 50 per cent of the company. Research limitations/implications As at European level laws on insider trading have been updated recently, future research could study this phenomenon after 2002, investigating if new laws were able to guarantee strong efficiency of the Italian market. Originality/value This paper is interesting because it is one of the few studies on insider trading carried out outside the USA. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The stock price reaction is larger for joint venture announcements. The market response is also larger for non-state owned companies and when the announcement is released in a period of rising stock prices. The announced investment has no impact on the non-voting shares but increases the voting shares' market price through a significant revaluation of their vote-segment. We find some evidence that new investments lead to management's private benefits rather than towards firm value. This is consistent with the typical Italian corporate governance structure, where a majority shareholder safely controls a listed company while having only a fractional claim on the firm's cash flows. © 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},
